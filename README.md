So this game is going to be a classic sidescroller
It will take place in space where the player will control a spaceship
that flies up and down and maybe a bit to the left and right
enemies will spawn on the right side of the screen and approach the player while shooting
the player's goal will be to survive as long as possible against increasing waves of enemies
