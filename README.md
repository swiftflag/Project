SPACE DEFENDERS

A classic sidescroller videogame that takes place in space, you play as a spaceship that fights off ever-increasing waves
of enemies in order to reach a higher and higher score!

About: This game is inspired by classic games like Galaga and Space Invaders, with waves of ever-increasing enemies
that fly towards the player, the goal of the player is to keep them from flying off-screen behind them, they have
ten lives, so if ten spaceships fly off-screen the game is over and you are left with your score! Each spaceship is
worth one point when destroyed!


Instructions: The controls of the game are very simple, the spaceship constantly moves until it hits the top or bottom
border of the screen, to change direction press the up or down arrows, you can also fire lasers in order to destroy
enemy spaceships by pressing space! Be warned however, as time goes on, the amount of enemies spawned scales with time!
Do your best to not let any spaceships get past you!
