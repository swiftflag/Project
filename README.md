So this game is going to be a classic sidescroller
It will take place in space where the player will control a spaceship
that flies up and down and maybe a bit to the left and right
enemies will spawn on the right side of the screen and approach the player while shooting
the player's goal will be to survive as long as possible against increasing waves of enemies
the player will also be able to pick up several randomly spawning powerups
one of which will be an increase in the projectile size that it fires
